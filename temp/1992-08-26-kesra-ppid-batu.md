When I was in college, there was a course that required an internship at a company or government institution. I chose to do an internship in the communication and information service (DISKOMINFO) of Batu City.

Back then, I was given the responsibility to design, build, and maintain websites for KESRA (Kesejahteraan Rakyat) & PPID (Pejabat Pengelola Informasi dan Dokumentasi).

There's nothing I'm proud of from this project, it looks old-fashioned and has no special features. Just an ordinary profile website.

But this is the first website I made. From this project I learned a lot, especially the overall workflow of the website. I also started to like and learn to use various jquery libraries. Then I realized that customizing web-based applications can be unlimited.

The knowledge, experience, and motivation that I got from this project became the basic capital of my career in website development.
