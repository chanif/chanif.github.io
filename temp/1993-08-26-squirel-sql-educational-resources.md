Squirel is an acronym for "*Sumber Belajar SQL Terlengkap*" or the most complete SQL learning resources. This is my thesis project. The main purpose of this project is clearly seen in its name :)

I labeled it "the most complete" because it contained many things: easy-to-understand SQL learning material combined with a leveling system to motivate students to progress. More than that, it contains quiz/evaluations, discussion forums, social networks, online SQL compilers, and various references about SQL.

One of the highlighted parts from this project is the client-side SQL compiler. Back than (in 2013), I could say it was the first online MySQL compiler that not require server request to compile MySQL query.

It can be done because I found SQL compiler coded in C++ and then i convert it to javascript using Emscripten.
