### Overview

[ChartSnap](https://www.chartsnap.com) is a web-based application with initial functions as a marketplace for trading strategies.

While working on this project, we realized the enormous potential of this application. Not only potential in Business to Business (B2B), but also in Business to Customer (B2C).

With consideration to boost the *ChartSnap* name, we decided to prioritize the B2C version by releasing a mobile application (Android and iOS) that utilized some of the *ChartSnap* functions under the name [Signal Today](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chartsnap.signaltoday&hl=en).

**Signal Today** is a kind of signaling application. We installed around 60 trading strategies and it has the ability to determine which trading strategies are suitable for a particular company by considering the validity and profit ratio in the past year.

ChartSnap status is beta and we are working to develop it further. Signal Today has been released, but we recognize that there are still many improvements needed, especially in terms of speed.
