### Overview

Field-iQ is a CRM (Customer Relation Management) of PT. HM. Sampoerna, it consists of 2 applications, web and iOS, which have similar features.

Based on Wikipedia, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a process companies use to understand their customer groups and respond quickly and at times, instantly to shifting customer desires. CRM technology allows firms to collect and manage large amounts of customer data and then carry out strategies based on that information.

In its development, we only made enhancement, so many enhancement that took 2 years to complete. This is the biggest project I have ever done. My role in this project is semi front-end developer. I call it 'semi' because most data is processed & calculated in JavaScript.

[//]: # (Field-iQ has two main user authorities, salesman and supervisor. Salesman role is used to manage customers and sales. Supervisor role is used to track and manage salesman.)
