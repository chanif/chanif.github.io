### Overview

This project is an excellent example of a solution that evolved organically to meet dynamic business needs.

What began with a specific feature—to organize tour participants by bus and room—organically expanded into a comprehensive digital ecosystem composed of three core applications:

1.  **A CMS (Content Management System)** to power the feliatour.com website.
2.  **An advanced Event Manager** for solidmice.com, equipped with features to manage cashback & discounts via a queue system, and provide transaction summaries from all event stalls.
3.  **LapakTour**, a marketplace platform designed to facilitate collaboration between travel agents. This platform represents the culmination of the project's evolution and is currently under development.

This project demonstrates the ability to adapt to an expanding scope and deliver a multifaceted, integrated software solution.
