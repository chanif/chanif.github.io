### Overview

To be honest, this page does not fully contain an explanation of LapakTour.

This is the result of a poorly planned project, although all developers know that planning is the most crucial thing in developing applications.

Starting from a simple project to create an application that has a feature to group tour participants by bus & room, which then grows into 3 applications:

1. CMS for feliatour.com
2. Event manager for solidmice.com that has ability to manage cashback & discount with a queue system, and summary transaction data from all the stalls at certain events.
3. LapakTour, the marketplace for tour packages that also has a feature for sharing tour packages between travel agents. LapakTour is still under development.
